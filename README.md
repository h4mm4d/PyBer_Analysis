# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
PyBer is a ride sharing company that uses Python based app. The goal of this analysis is to provide insight on the data gathered in an excel sheet format using Python, Panda, Matplotlib. We will be using those tools to determine drivers in suburban cities, urban cities, and rural cities. The presentation to stakeholders should include.
1.	Total number of rides by city type using bubble chart 
2.	Ride count per passenger by city type by using box and whisker plot
3.	Numbers of pie charts for.
Percent of total Fares by City Type 
Percent of Total Rides by City Type
Percent of Total Drivers by City Type and 
4.	Line chart for Total Fare by City type per month 
We will explore results in the results section.
## Results: 
### Total number of rides by city type
Bubble chart is a type of scattered chart that helps provide not only data points also size of the data size. The x-axis shows the number of rides per city, y-axis is for the average fare for that city, the color of the bubble represents city type and size number of drivers in that city. 
From the chart, we can see Average fare is higher in rural cities and number of rides per city as well number of drivers is much higher in urban cities. 
From the chart, we can infer
1. There are a lot more business available in urban areas and also lot more drivers. 
2. However, average fare is much lower in urban cities than in rural and suburban cities. 
3. As urban cities have higher population density than suburban and rural cities, demand and supply for the ride is higher. However, those rides cover a shorter distance, therefore, average fare is lower.  
4. There are two cities that has a lot of drivers but average fare is about $20 could use some further analysis to see if average fare could be increased by adjusting price or reducing number of drivers.

### Ride count per passenger by city type
Box and whisker is a great way to represent statistics summary for a dataset. It shows distribution of data as well as outliers if any. Below is the ride count data by city type
